    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #2c3e50;">Why Consistency Matters More Than Motivation in Learning</h1>

    <p>When we start learning something new—whether it's coding, a subject in school, or even a language—we often feel very motivated. But that motivation doesn’t last forever. Some days, we just don’t feel like studying or practicing. That’s where **consistency** becomes more important than motivation.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">1. Motivation is Temporary</h2>
    <p>Motivation comes and goes. It might be a video, a quote, or a personal goal that pushes you to start. But what happens when you're tired or distracted? If you rely only on motivation, you'll stop the moment it disappears.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">2. Consistency Builds Habits</h2>
    <p>Doing something small every day builds a habit. Even studying for 30 minutes daily can lead to big improvements over time. You don’t have to wait for motivation—you just do it, like brushing your teeth. It's a routine, not a decision you debate daily.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">3. Small Steps Add Up</h2>
    <p>Learning isn’t about doing a lot in one day. It’s about doing a little, every day. Think of it like planting seeds. You water them daily—not once a month—to grow strong plants. The same applies to your skills and knowledge.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">4. Consistency Creates Discipline</h2>
    <p>Discipline is stronger than motivation. It helps you study even when you don’t feel like it. When you stay consistent, you train your mind to stay focused and committed. Over time, it becomes easier.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">5. Results Come with Time</h2>
    <p>Success doesn’t happen in a week. Whether it's learning C programming, building websites, or preparing for exams—real progress comes with regular effort. The students who improve the most are not the most motivated, but the most consistent.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Motivation might help you get started, but consistency is what keeps you going. It’s okay if you don’t feel excited every day—just keep showing up. That’s where true growth happens.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-style: italic; color: #7f8c8d;">Remember: "Success doesn't come from what you do occasionally, it comes from what you do consistently."</p>
