<p>Starting your journey in Computer Science Engineering can be overwhelming. As a first-year student, you might be wondering where to begin with coding. In this blog, I’ll share 5 practical tips that helped me take my first steps into the world of programming.</p>

<h2>1. Master the Basics</h2>
<p>Start with a beginner-friendly language like <strong>C</strong>. It helps you understand the core of programming such as loops, functions, and memory management. Don't rush – take time to understand <em>why</em> things work, not just how.</p>

<h2>2. Practice Daily</h2>
<p>Even solving 2–3 problems daily on platforms like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com" target="_blank">HackerRank</a> or <a href="https://www.codechef.com" target="_blank">CodeChef</a> helps build muscle memory. Consistency is key.</p>

<h2>3. Work on Small Projects</h2>
<p>Build mini-projects like a calculator, to-do list, or clone a basic website (I built a Myntra Clone!). It boosts your confidence and lets you apply what you learn.</p>

<h2>4. Use YouTube & Free Resources</h2>
<p>Channels like CodeWithHarry, Apna College, and freeCodeCamp offer beginner-level tutorials that are easy to understand. Use them to clear concepts and follow along.</p>

<h2>5. Stay Connected with Peers</h2>
<p>Join student communities like <b>Nebula Coders</b>, participate in events, and discuss doubts. Learning with others makes the journey easier and more fun.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Don’t compare yourself with others. Everyone learns at their own pace. Stay curious, keep building, and don’t give up. Your future self will thank you!</p>
