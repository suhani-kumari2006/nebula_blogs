<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As a first-year Computer Science Engineering student, I recently created a <b>Myntra Clone</b> using HTML and CSS. It was my first real web development project, and I learned a lot while building it.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The project replicates the basic design and layout of the original Myntra website, including a homepage, navbar, categories, and product listings.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML for structure</li>
  <li>CSS for styling</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
<p>Aligning elements correctly and making the site responsive for different screen sizes were some of the challenges I faced.</p>

<h2>Live Preview</h2>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project helped me gain confidence in frontend development. I'm excited to learn JavaScript next and build more interactive websites.</p>
