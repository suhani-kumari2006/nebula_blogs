    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #2c3e50;">How I Use LinkedIn as a Student to Build My Career Early</h1>

    <p>As a first-year engineering student, I used to think LinkedIn was only for professionals with years of experience. But soon I realized it's actually a great platform to start building my career early—even as a student.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">1. Creating a Strong Profile</h2>
    <p>I started by adding a good profile picture, a headline that shows I'm a BTech student interested in tech, and a summary that tells what I'm learning and what I'm passionate about. I also listed my college, courses, and projects.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">2. Sharing My Work</h2>
    <p>Whenever I complete a project—like a website or a blog—I make a simple post about it. I explain what I made, what tools I used, and what I learned. This helps me get noticed and also shows my progress.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">3. Connecting with Others</h2>
    <p>I connect with seniors, mentors, and people from tech communities. I always add a short message like “I’m a student learning web development, would love to connect and learn from your journey.”</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">4. Learning from My Feed</h2>
    <p>My LinkedIn feed is full of helpful content—career tips, coding resources, internship updates, and motivational posts from students like me. I save helpful posts and follow people who share valuable insights.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">5. Building My Personal Brand</h2>
    <p>By consistently posting, sharing wins (big or small), and engaging with others, I'm slowly building a personal brand. People start recognizing my name, and it opens the door to internships, collaborations, and mentorship.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">6. Staying Consistent</h2>
    <p>I try to post once or twice a week, even if it's a small update like “completed a CSS project” or “learning recursion in C.” Over time, it builds momentum and shows growth.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2980b9;">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>LinkedIn isn’t just for job hunting. For students like me, it’s a platform to learn, connect, and grow. Starting early means when I actually need an internship or job, I’ll already have a strong presence and network.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-style: italic; color: #7f8c8d;">If you're a student reading this, don’t wait. Start using LinkedIn now</p>
